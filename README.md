# Siggisgis

Siggisgis is a simple and introductary geographical information system meant for beginners. The web-application was developed during a course called Programming in geomatics at NTNU Trondheim the spring of 2020. It is developed by me Siggi(short for Sigrid), and is therefore called SiggisGis.
I have implemented the most basic GIS tools, and tried to make the application as simple to use as possible.
The implemented tools are the following : 

- Buffer
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Dissolve
- Feature selector
- Clip 
- Draw

Visit the web-application at siggisgis.herokuapp.com to see more. 

If you wish to test the application you can simply draw some figures to test some of the tools. Some real data from the Trondheim area can be found in the testdata.zip, simply upload this zip-file to the application and get startet!
